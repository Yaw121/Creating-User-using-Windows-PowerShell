### Creating-User-using-Windows-PowerShell

- In this task, a user will be created using Windows PowerShell. The User and Group Management Lab project aimed to demonstrate the process of creating and managing user accounts and group memberships in a Windows domain environment. The primary focus was to create a new Active Directory user and add the user to a security group using Windows PowerShell. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of Active Directory administration, role-based access control, and PowerShell scripting for system management.


### Skills Learned from the Lab
- Active Directory Management: Gained hands-on experience in creating and managing user accounts in Active Directory.

- PowerShell Scripting: Learned to use Windows PowerShell cmdlets for automating user and group management tasks.

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Developed an understanding of security group memberships and their role in controlling access permissions.

- Organizational Unit Structure: Practiced organizing users within specific OUs for efficient management.

- Automation in IT Operations: Improved skills in automating repetitive administrative tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

- Troubleshooting and Error Handling: Gained practical experience in resolving common issues in user and group management workflows.

- System Administration Best Practices: Learned to apply security and compliance principles when managing user accounts and access control.

  ### Tools Used
- Windows PowerShell: For executing commands and automating the creation and management of users and security groups.

- Active Directory (AD): To manage and organize user accounts and groups within a Windows domain environment.

- Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell: To provide cmdlets specifically designed for interacting with Active Directory.

- Windows Server: To host and manage the Active Directory domain environment.

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or PowerShell ISE: For writing, editing, and debugging PowerShell scripts.

- Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop (if applicable)**: For remote management and access to the lab environment.

- Domain Controller: As the central server for managing authentication and authorization in the domain.
